##ABOUT

This is a programming excercise for CultureAmp.
The problem involves making a program to parse and display
Wherever possible I've attempted to follow SOLID design principals.

In this repo there is a task.md file which describes the task and it's requirements

##HOW TO RUN

1. Download this repo by clicking the download as zip button

##DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS

##FOCUS ON SOLID DESIGN

- There an attempt to show single responsbility design
- An example is the use of methods such as "valid_file?" This method is easily isolated and tested
- I/O is isolated to the run.rb file
- 

Wherever possible there is no hard coding.
